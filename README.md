# Aqua-Air-Health-Guard-Simulation-and-Hardware

The Aqua-Air Health Guard project aims to provide health monitoring. With a focus on water and air quality, this system integrates sensor technologies with the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to collect real-time data on parameters such as pH, turbidity, temperature, CO, CO2, and NH3.

The file - gasSensors.py consists of python code for the sensors MQ9 and MQ135 along with Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.
We have used Thonny to upload code to the Raspberry Pi Pico and retrieve sensor readings.

The file - main.py consists of python code for the simulation of both air and water sesnors - that is, MQ9, MQ135, pH sesor, turbidity and temperature sensor.

The values for the calibration coefficients used in this code are placeholders and not actual calibration values. The specific values for the calibration coefficients should be determined through a proper calibration process tailored to the particular gas being measured and the specific characteristics of the sensor.
